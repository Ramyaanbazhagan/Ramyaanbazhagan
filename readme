This Python script trains a neural network using the Wine dataset from sklearn.datasets. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and follows a supervised learning approach for multi-class classification.

1. Importing Required Libraries

numpy: For numerical operations.
tensorflow & keras: To build and train the neural network.
sklearn.datasets: Loads the Wine dataset.
sklearn.model_selection: Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
sklearn.preprocessing: Standardizes features and encodes labels.

2. Loading the Dataset

The Wine dataset is loaded using load_wine(), where:
X contains numerical features of different wine samples.
y contains integer labels representing different wine classes.

3. Preprocessing the Data

One-Hot Encoding: Converts categorical target values into a binary matrix format.
Splitting the Dataset: train_test_split() divides the data into 80% training and 20% testing.
Feature Scaling: StandardScaler() normalizes feature values for better performance.

4. Defining the Neural Network

The model is a feedforward neural network with three layers:
First layer: 16 neurons, ReLU activation, input shape = number of features.
Second layer: 8 neurons, ReLU activation.
Output layer: Number of classes neurons, Softmax activation (for multi-class classification).

5. Compiling the Model

Optimizer: Adam (adaptive learning rate optimization).
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy (suitable for multi-class classification).
Metric: Accuracy (to measure classification performance).

6. Training the Model

The model is trained for 50 epochs with a batch size of 8.
Uses validation data to track performance on unseen data.

7. Evaluating the Model

After training, the model is tested on the test set.
The final test accuracy is printed.
